# ⚡ Novus

**Novus** — Latin for *"new"* — represents a fresh, intuitive approach to learning and building circuits.  
It’s a lightweight circuit editor created for **[CodePi](https://codepi-ic-2025-1.devpost.com/)** hackathon on **[Devpost](https://devpost.com)** that allows you to visually connect components, simulate ideas, and explore the fundamentals of electronics — all in your browser.

## 🧠 Inspiration

I built Novus to simplify circuit-building for STEM learners and hobbyists.

Most tools in this space are either too complex or too abstract — Novus bridges the gap by combining technical accuracy with visual clarity

## 🔮 Roadmap

- Circuit simulation engine (Ohm’s Law, Series/Parallel logic)
- More components (LEDs, switches, capacitors, etc.)
- Pan & Zoom
- Export/share circuits
- Dark mode
